fma metadata can be downloaded at the following link [metadata](https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_metadata.zip) <br/>
the small data set can be downloaded [here](https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_small.zip) (7.2Gb). This contains 8000 tracks spread across 8 genres <br/>

I think we will probably just be using the stuff included in the metadata. Downloading that is necessary to run the notebook
